## Introduction
Code reviews can inspire dread in both reviewer and reviewee. Having your
code analyzed can feel like getting screened by the TSA as you go off to a
beautiful vacation. Even worse, reviewing other people's code can feel like
a painful and ambiguous exercise, searching for problems and not even knowing where to begin.

This project aims to provide some solid tips for how to review the code you and your team write. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it should help you catch as many bugs as possible from a small and memorable set of ideas that can hopefully be applied to any review.

## Why Review Code?
Code reviews are a necessary part of the software engineering process because you alone as a developer can't catch every problem in a piece of code you write. That's ok though! Even the best basketball players in the world miss shots.

Having others review our work ensures that we deliver the best product to users and with the least amount of errors. Make sure your team implements a code review process for new code that is introduced into your codebase. Find a process that works for you and your team, there's no one size fits all. The import point is to do code reviews as regularly as possible
