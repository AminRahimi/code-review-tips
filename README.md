# code-review-tips

Code reviews can inspire dread in both reviewer and reviewee. Having your
code analyzed can feel like getting screened by the TSA as you go off to a
beautiful vacation. Even worse, reviewing other people's code can feel like
a painful and ambiguous exercise, searching for problems and not even knowing where to begin.

This project aims to provide some solid tips for how to review the code you and your team write. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but it should help you catch as many bugs as possible from a small and memorable set of ideas that can hopefully be applied to any review.
